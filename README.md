## Merging Strategy Used
- **`Merging initial-version into main`**: This merge was done earlier using terminal to bring the folder structure (like docs and images) from initial-version to main. It sets up the necessary files and folder organization.
- **`Merging final-version into main`**: After the final revisions were completed, the final-version branch was be merged into main through GitHubâ€™s online interface to update the document with the most current, finalized content.
